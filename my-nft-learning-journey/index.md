# My NFT Learning Journey

## How it started
I recently started a new job. In the first few weeks I find myself having a conversation with a new coworker and the topic of crypto currencies and blockchain comes up. Then and probably now too, I understood the very basics. He expressed an opinion that blockchain and Web 3.0 in general is the future of the internet. I hadn't thought of it like that before. Blockchain made sense to me on principle but "the future of the internet"? I wasn't sure, but he knew what he was talking about on every other topic we'd discussed so maybe he was on to something.

Not wanting to show how little I knew about crypto currency, I decided to change topics to something I was more sure of. "Yeah, they might be", I said, "but what about NFT's? that makes zero sense, it's all just a big scam right?".

"I don't know", he repied, "I think there may be something to them too". He went on to explain that he didn't know a lot about them either but had heard a recent Tim Ferris Podcast episode where people seemed pretty excited about the idea.

I'm a Ferris fan, but hadn't listened in a while. I downloaded the pod and queued it up for the way home.
The podcast in question was [this one](https://tim.blog/2021/10/28/chris-dixon-naval-ravikant/) with Chris Dixon and Naval Ravikant

Well, I listened, and I got another perspective. Naval and Chris did a great job of explaining the potential with NFTs to be more than just trading dumb jpgs which is what I'd assumed it to be until now. But I didn't totally understand it. I figured the best way to understand it better was to get involved. I needed to find an NFT to buy. Something that didn't cost much, with an active discord where I could learn stuff, and as Naval explained "make sure you only buy NFT art that you like, because it could very well end up being worth nothing and then all you have left is the art" (paraphrased).

So, next step, I go to opensea.io and I start to poke about. One of the first things I found was the Billionaire Zombie Club.

[Billionaire Zombie number 3016](https://opensea.io/collection/billionairezombiesclub)

I don't recall exactly how I found it, but I think it might have been the front page of opensea. There were about 2000 minted already, I saw the URL for the site and went to take a look before deciding if I wanted to buy one. Also, I had no clue how to get money onto OpenSea.

On [https://billionairezombies.club/](https://billionairezombies.club/) I learned that I could "mint" right from the site, but wait, what is minting?
